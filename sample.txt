Hi Roshni, this side Mangesh here. I am calling from TouchCore system. Shall we start with your interview? So can you please give me a brief introduction of yourself? Hi Mangesh, I am Roshni. I am from Kerala. So I have been working in Django and React in my previous role. So I have done my bachelor's from Kerala itself. That's all from my side. Okay, thanks for the information Roshni. So yeah, let's start with the interview. So my first question, can you describe time when you had a quickly adjust to significant change at work? And how did you handle it? So at my previous job, our team had to switch to a new project management software with only a few weeks notice. So I took the initiative to quickly learn the new system by attending online tutorials and reading the documentation. I then organized a short training session for my colleagues also to help them get up to speed. So this approach not only helped our team transition smoothly, but also kept the project on track. That's great. Okay, so the second question is how do you ensure transparency within your team when working on a project? Okay, so I believe that regular and open communication is a key to transparency. In my last project, I set up weekly progress meetings and daily check-ins where everyone could share their updates, challenges and any changes in their project scope. And additionally, I made sure that all relevant documents and updates were accessible to the entire team on our shared drive. This way, everyone was always informed about the project status. Oh, that's great. Okay, well, moving to the next question. Tell me about a successful team project you were part of and what was your role? How did you contribute to the team's success? So I was a part of a cross-functional team tasked with launching a new product. My role was to coordinate between the marketing, designing and engineering teams. I facilitated regular brainstorming sessions and ensured everyone's ideas and feedback were heard and considered. By fostering an environment of mutual respect and open communication, we were able to launch the product ahead of the schedule and exceed our sales target. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Roshni. So coming to the next question. Can you provide an example of time when you come up with a creative solution to a problem? Okay. So, in my previous company, we faced a challenge with declining customer engagement in our app. So I proposed implementing a gamification strategy to make the app more engaging. I designed a reward system that encouraged users to complete various tasks within the app. So this idea was well-received and after implementation, we saw a 30% increase in user engagement within the first three months. Okay, that's good. Well, coming to the last question. Describe a situation where you took responsibility for a mistake you made and how did you handle it? So, in my past role, I made an error in the financial report that resulted in a budget overestimation. Once I realized my mistake, I immediately informed my team about it. I then worked overtime to correct the report and implemented a double-check system to prevent similar errors in the future. So, taking ownership of my mistake and finding a solution helped restore trust and improved our reporting process. Yeah, Roshni, you're a long-term developer. So, you must have had a lot of experience Yeah, Roshni, your last answer was very nice. I really appreciate that you gave almost all the answers and I really appreciate and thanks for giving your time. My team will get in touch with you shortly. So, do you have any questions, any query for me? No, nothing from my side on this. Okay, okay. Thanks, Roshni. Have a good day. Bye. Thank you.
